# Building what you don't know

I came across The Grid when the queue was almost one you'd stand and physically wait in. Silly as I was, I didn't sign up then. Or the next time I came back to the site. It took me until the queue had grown way to long for being one you'd actually stand and wait in and my founding member number ended up being 24107\.

Yesterday I got the email that it was my turn and I'm incredibly excited to try it out.  I've brought up The Grid as an example in many of my talks and as a UX designer I'm fascinated by both the technical side of how it actually works and by the UX side of it. Can a site really design it self? Will it actually be any good? 

I'm pretty sure it will be, but this, writing a post and publishing a site that I have no idea what it's going to look like, or how it's going to work, that's new. A bit backwards, but also quite forward thinking. If feels fun and a little like an adventure.  

Hello The Grid. Let's see what you can do.
